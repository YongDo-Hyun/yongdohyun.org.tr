# Creating an instance

To create an instance, simply click on the **Add Instance** button on the top menu bar, or right-click an empty area in the middle of the launcher, and select **Create instance**. You can then either create a new instance by selecting your desired Minecraft version and modloader, or import an existing modpack by selecting a mod platform from the sidebar on the left.
