# Migrating instances from ProjT Launcher

In order to transfer an instance, or multiple instances from Prism Launcher to ProjT Launcher, you must begin the process by opening Prism Launcher on your computer.

Now that Prism Launcher is open, navigate to the **Folders** tab located on the top menu bar, to the left of the Settings tab.

Left-click on the tab and select the **View Instance Folder** option. This should then open your system's file explorer application with the correct directory in view.

Now that the Prism Launcher instance directory is open, you may **select**, and then **copy** the instances that you wish to transfer.

To complete the transfer process, you must now open ProjT Launcher.

As you did in Prism Launcher previously, navigate to the **Folders** tab located on the top menu bar, to the left of the Settings tab.

Left-click on the tab and select the **Instances** option. This should once again open your system's file explorer application with the correct directory in view.

Now that the ProjT Launcher instance directory is open, you may **paste** the instance(s) that you previously copied from the Prism Launcher directory.

*Optional: If you would like to transfer your pack icon selections, navigate up from the Prism Launcher instances folder to the main Prism Launcher folder. Do the same for Prism Launcher. Copy the* **icons** *folder from Prism Launcher to Prism Launcher.*

## Finishing up

Now, in **ProjT Launcher**, your instances should appear as they normally would in Prism Launcher.

If you have transferred instances across devices or packaging formats, you may need to change the version of **Java** that'll be used to launch Minecraft. You can learn how to do so on [this page](../installing-java).
