# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is ProjT Launcher?

ProjT was forked from the PrismLauncher project in late 2025.

The original fork was a result of continuing disagreements between a portion of the community and MultiMC's lead maintainer, which ultimately led to the creation of Prism Launcher. However, ProjT Launcher itself forked from the Prism Launcher codebase. ProjT's main motivation is not only to uphold the freedom of 3rd party packaging and re-distribution but also to offer an alternative for users dissatisfied with Prism's development pace, aiming to be a project that focuses on adding new features and is generally more open to development.
