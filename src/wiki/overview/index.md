# Welcome to the ProjT Launcher Wiki!

If you're new to ProjT Launcher and not quite sure where to begin, please go to [Getting Started](./getting-started).

ProjT Launcher is a free and open source Minecraft launcher forked from the Prism Launcher project, with the ability to manage multiple accounts, as well as instances, each with their own mods, resource packs, and more! Our project has a much greater focus on both user-freedom, and the incorporation of new and exciting features and functionality.

Please **do not** contact the Prism Launcher team regarding issues related ProjT Launcher.
